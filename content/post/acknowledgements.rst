Acknowlegements and Attributions
################################

Every project, no matter how lonely, builds upon the efforts of others.
:title:`Hugo B-side` is no different.

.. pull-quote::

   If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.

   -- Isaac Newton, 1675.


Acknowlegements
***************

Most everything this author knows about Hugo themes
and Hugo templating, he has learned by studying the very useful
`Ananke Theme <https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/>`__.
`Bud Parr <https://github.com/budparr>`__
has done us all a great favor with his careful development of this theme.
Ananke proved to be one of the better teaching tools I have found
for understanding how templates actually work in Hugo.

A "wall of text" is rarely pleasant to look at.
Good images help the readability of almost any text.
The world is made richer by those artists who share their work
through the creative commons.

For the `Hugo and reStructuredText </post/hugo-and-rest/>`__ page,
I have borrowed a couple of typography-related images from
the incredibly useful
`Wikimedia Commons <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>`__.
